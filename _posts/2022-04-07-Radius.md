title: Cisco ISE Personas
---

**Common Cisco ISE Terminology**
 **Service:** A service is a specific feature that a persona provides, such as network access, profiler, posture, security group access, monitoring and troubleshooting, and so on.
**Node:** A node is an individual instance that runs the Cisco ISE software. Cisco ISE is available as an appliance and also as a software that can be run on VMware. Each instance (appliance or VMware) that runs the Cisco ISE software is called a node.
**Persona:** The persona of a node determines the services provided by the node. A Cisco ISE node can assume any of the following personas-Administration, Policy Service, Monitoring, and pxGrid. The menu options that are available through the Admin portal are dependent on the role and personas that a Cisco ISE node assumes.

**Monitoring Node (MnT):**
 - Monitoring Node is where all the logs are collected and where report generation occurs.
 - Monitoring node or persona (MnT) is responsible for managing and storing the log files.
 - Monitoring node or persona (MnT) Responsible for troubleshooting tools in Cisco ISE.
 - Monitoring & Troubleshooting Persona (M&T) is Maximum Per Deployment are two 2.
 - HA Mode is like Active/Passive; all Monitoring Node M&T nodes receive all log copies.
 - Every event that occurs within the Cisco ISE topology is logged to the monitoring node.
 - Generate reports show current status of connected devices & unknown devices network.
 - Monitoring node or persona (MnT) receives logging from PAN, PSN, RADIUS and TACACS.


**Policy Administration Node (PAN):**
 - The Policy Administration Node is where the administrator logs into to configure policies.
 - Use by Network Admin to configure or modify authentication and authorization policies.
 - Administration persona allows you to perform all administrative operations on Cisco ISE.
 - Policy Administration Node (PAN) responsible for syncing other node types with itself.
 - Policy Administration responsible for maintaining the overall deployment configuration.
 - In Cisco ISE PAN is responsible for providing the GUI for configuration and management.
 - Administration Persona (PAN), Maximum Per Deployment are 2, HA Mode Active/Passive.
 - Once configured on the PAN the changes are pushed out to the policy services nodes.
 - Handles all system related configuration & configure as standalone, primary or secondary.
 - In Cisco ISE, Policy Administration Node (PAN) service provide the GUI of the ISE device.
 - Policy Administration Node (PAN) provides licensing, Admin audit and authentication etc.


**Policy Services Node (PSN):**
 - Responsible for processing all requests Authentication, Authorization, Profiling & pxGrid.
 - Policy & Service Persona (PSN), Maximum Per Deployment are 50, HA Mode: Active/Active.
 - In larger deployments you use multiple PSNâ€™s to spread the load of all the network requests.
 - PSN provides network access, posture, guest access, client provisioning & profiling services.
 - There must be at least one Policy & Service Persona (PSN) in a distributed setup in Cisco ISE.
 - The small Cisco ISE deployment can have a maximum of two 2 policy service nodes (PSN).
 - The medium Cisco ISE deployment can have a maximum of 5 policy service nodes (PSN).
 - The large Cisco ISE deployment can have a maximum of 50 policy service nodes (PSN).
 - Actually, Policy Services Node (PSN) is an actual Radios Server in Identity Services Engine.
 - Policy Service Node will also perform COA deployment, Posturing and Profiling Services.
 - Guest Portals are hosted on Policy Service Node (PSN) as well as PSN act as Built-in CA.
 - These nodes process all of the authentication requests coming from the infrastructure.
 - PSN directly communicates to external identity stores for user authentications in Cisco ISE.
 - Provides GUI for sponsors, agent download, guests access and device registration etc.

**PxGrid Node:**
PxGrid is used to share context-sensitive information from Cisco ISE session directory with other network systems such as ISE Eco system partner systems and other Cisco platforms. The pxGrid framework can also be used to exchange policy and configuration data between nodes like sharing tags and policy objects between Cisco ISE and third-party vendors, and for other information exchanges.
